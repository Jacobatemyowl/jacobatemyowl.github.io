        <p class="text-white">First Person Shooter / Tower Defense</p>
        <br>
        <p class="text-white">Titans' Towers was my capstone project for Full Sail University. I was a part of Team
          Titans with 5 of my peers. We wanted a project that we could learn a lot from as we went through the
          development process, as well as a project that would showcase what we were capable of for our respective
          portfolios. </p>
        <p class="text-white">We settled on the genre of the game after discussing what we could learn the most from. A
          tower defense game provided enough complexity and balancing issues that it seemed perfect to cut our teeth on.
          To make the game more accessible for the average player. we decided to make it first person as well. </p>
        <p class="text-white">My contributions to the game include the core gunplay (including shooting, aiming,
          reloading, and ammunition), designing multiple levels through multiple iterations, from blockmesh to final
          passes with lighting and art assets. </p>

    <p class="text-white text-center">Entry level designed for the campaign</p>

      </div>
      <div class="col-sm-8 text-left">
        <h1 class="display-4 text-white" style="font-size: 2em;">THE TOWER</h1>
        <p class="text-white">The tower featured in the level serves as the landmark of the level. The level's purpose
          was designed to give life to the title of the game, as well as serve as a starting point for players to learn
          and practice the tower placing system. </p>
        <p class="text-white">The player begins the level on an elevator and descends into the lobby. They are then
          greeted with flashing red lights and small sirens indicating that the tower is under attack. A beam of lights
          guides the player out the door and into the playfield. The lobby area is meant to be a small area that does
          not serve any functional purpose to the game; it is merely just an explorable area that adds to the lore of
          the world. </p>

      </div>
      <div class="col-sm-8 text-left">
        <h1 class="display-4 text-white" style="font-size: 2em;">LAST STAND</h1>
        <p class="text-white">As I mentioned before, this level was designed to serve as the starting point for the
          player. As such, it features a rather simple building grid that I called "Last Stand." The player was to
          protect the tower from the enemies that would spawn and attack the CORE. </p>
        <p class="text-white">Last Stand is a symmetrical, straight path for the player to build on. It teaches the
          player how to manage their available walls and how certain towers work. It gives the basic skills that players
          will use throughout each level. </p>
      </div>

    <div class="row align-items-center">

      </div>
      <div class="col-sm-8 text-left">
        <h1 class="display-4 text-white" style="font-size: 2em;">THE CAFETERIA</h1>
        <p class="text-white">The cafeteria is found behind an impassable door that the player can see through but
          cannot actually explore. I meant for this area to be another portion that adds to the lore of the world and a
          neat area that the player could find if they looked around enough. Just like the lobby, it does not serve any
          functional part of the level; it just adds to the lore. </p>
        <p class="text-white">I added these areas into my level for two reasons. The first was to work on my level
          designing and environmental storytelling skills. The second was as a homage to our reference game for our
          project: Sanctum 2. This game featured lots of areas like the cafeteria that didn't add anything to the
          gameplay but were fun to explore. </p>

        <h1 class="display-4 text-white" style="font-size: 2em;">VERTICALITY</h1>
        <p class="text-white">A key design pillar for the map was verticality. I wanted to challenge both the player and
          the traditional map layout of the tower-defense genre by forcing the player to build up and down on ramps
          instead of a straight path. </p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <br>
    <div class="row align-items-center">

      <div class="col-sm-8 text-left">
        <h1 class="display-4 text-white" style="font-size: 2em;">QUICK TRAVERSAL</h1>
        <p class="text-white">A challenge I had while designing the level was providing the player an accessible way to
          quickly travel up and down the map should the need arise. I came up with the idea of air ducts that would
          shoot both air and the player is a certain direction. For my prototype, I made them jump pads. To introduce
          the player to them, the player is spawned on a separate platform away from the main play area and the only way
          to access it is by using a jump pad. Once across, the player will find three more jump pads that send the
          player up varying heights to quickly access different levels of the ramp. </p>

      <div class="col-sm-8 text-left">
        <h1 class="display-4 text-white" style="font-size: 2em;">EBB AND FLOW</h1>
        <p class="text-white">While the tower-genre genre provides a natural ebb-and-flow, this particular level is
          hectic and picks the pace up quickly. I wanted to be able to balance that out and provide places for the
          player to back off if they need to and remain active while on the sidelines. There are multiple places around
          that map that provide relief from the enemy and advantageous positions if wanted.</p>
